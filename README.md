**Title – Immersive VR Sci-Fi Survival Experience: ORBITAL FAILURE**  
**Assignment Created By:** Mr. Aruna Ishara Gamage, Mr. Nushkan Nismi  
**End Digit:** 8  
**Assignment Weight:** 30%

## OBJECTIVE

Orbital Failure

Design and develop an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) sci-fi survival experience application using  
Unity, where the player is trapped inside a malfunctioning space station.

The player must navigate the station, interact with futuristic systems, issue voice-based system  
commands, and survive escalating failures through a voice-driven emergency challenge

---

## ASSIGNMENT STRUCTURE (2 Parts)

- **Part A (60%) – Based on Tutorials + Lab Sheets**  
  Students can score Part A using concepts and techniques covered in tutorials and lab sessions

- **Part B (40%) – Self-Learning + Advanced Work (Required for High Grades)**  
  Part B must include voice-controlled mechanics and a unique survival challenge developed  
  through independent research

---

## CORE REQUIREMENTS

## Part A Requirements (60%)

### 1. VR Movement & Locomotion

- Use teleportation or joystick-based movement
- Allow smooth navigation across multiple station areas (corridors, control rooms, engineering bays)

### 2. Futuristic System Interactable

- Implement at least three (3) of the following:
  - Control panels or terminals: Activate or monitor station systems
  - Valves, levers, or switches: Control power, pressure, or flow
  - Doors or airlock mechanisms: Open, close, or lock access points
  - Repairable system components: Fix damaged systems using interaction

### 3. VR UI Elements

- Include a HUD or VR-friendly UI displaying:
  - Station system status (power, oxygen, integrity)
  - Alerts or warnings
  - Timers or objectives

### 4. Basic Environmental Feedback

- Alarm sounds, flickering lights, warning sirens
- Environmental feedback reacting to player actions or failures

---

## Part B Requirements (40%) – Self Learning

### 5. Voice-Based System Command Control (Voice Input Only)

- The player must control at least three (3) station systems using voice commands only

Example Commands (DO NOT USE):

- “Restore Oxygen” – Stabilizes oxygen levels  
- “Seal Breach” – Closes hull damage  
- “Redirect Power” – Transfers power to critical systems  

#### IMPORTANT NOTE

- The system command phrases listed below are EXAMPLES ONLY
- Students MUST create their own original command phrases
- Using the example commands exactly as written will result in 0 marks for this component

The system must:

- Accurately detect commands using voice input tools (e.g., Windows Speech API (wit.ai)
- Provide visual/audio feedback upon successful commands recognition
- Show a response or warning for unrecognized commands
- Please note that the Windows Speech API will NOT work when the application is built and executed inside a VR environment

### 6. Voice Command Integration

- Integrate a real-time speech recognition system
- Provide visual and/or audio feedback for:
  - Successful system commands
  - Incorrect or unrecognized commands
- Voice system must remain responsive during gameplay

### 7. Dynamic Station Reaction System

- Voice commands and player actions must cause clear system-level reactions, such as:
  - Oxygen depletion or restoration
  - Emergency lighting or power loss
  - Alarm escalation or shutdown.

### 8. Emergency Challenge Area (Mandatory)

- Include a dedicated emergency sequence where the player must:
  - Use voice commands under time pressure
  - Interact with station systems to survive
  - Complete a repair, stabilization, or evacuation challenge

⚠️ Part B Creative Challenge Note

Part B includes a creative challenge, and it must be unique (not copied from other students) to score marks.

---

## Folder Structure & Code

- Unity project must follow the folder structure.
- Scripts and assets must be well-named and organized.

---

## Game Documentation

- Submit a PDF with:
  - Title, student name, and IT number
  - Game summary and spell list
  - Screenshots of gameplay
  - Control guide (movement, voice usage)
  - Credits for any assets/tools used

---

## Submission Requirements

### Windows .exe Build

Include .exe and Data folder, playable with a VR headset.

### Zipped Unity Project Folder

Must follow the folder structure.  
Upload to a shared Google Drive folder in Courseweb.

### Gameplay Demo Video

- 5 minutes showcasing:
  - Voice-activated spellcasting
  - Movement
  - Item collection and target interaction
  - Spellbook interaction
  - Challenge zone gameplay

---

## PLAGIARISM / ORIGINALITY VERIFICATION (VIVA)

- A mandatory one-to-one viva will be conducted
- Students must clearly explain:
  - Voice command logic
  - System interaction behavior
  - Emergency challenge design
- Failure to justify originality may result in mark deductions or zero marks
